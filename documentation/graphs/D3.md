# D3 in Oliver

D3 is commonly known as the gold standard for data visualization - however it comes with several known challenges.

Integrating D3 into a React project can be difficult because D3 uses data binding whereas React uses unidirectional data flow. D3 loads data, binds data to elements in the dom, transforms the elements by interpreting data, and transitions elements in response to user input. React on the other hand uses a virtual DOM to measure changes in state. To integrate these two libraries let React handle displaying the SVG information and D3 handle the math needed to render data.

### Approaches

- Use a root React component to render an empty, customizable SVG.
- Wrap D3 methods in lifecycle methods. Pass D3 methods in as a method. The limitation here is that server side rendering is not possible with this approach.
- Use D3 for math and React for rendering. This is the approach Oliver will take.

Another interesting behavior that I will take advantage of is d3's modularization. D3 is made of of imports of certain libraries. Through this I will be able to import select libraries and their classes rather than importing d3 as a whole.
