# D3 in Oliver

Oliver will display graphical information to make data visualization easier to comprehend. I have chosen to use D3 for this task as it is commonly known as the gold standard for data visualization - however this comes with several known challenges.

Integrating D3 into a React project can be difficult because D3 uses data binding whereas React uses unidirectional data flow. D3 loads data, binds data to elements in the dom, transforms the elements by interpreting data, and transitions elements in response to user input. React on the other hand uses a virtual DOM to measure changes in state. To integrate these two libraries let React handle displaying the SVG information and D3 handle the math needed to render data.

## Integrating D3 into Oliver componenets

Due to D3 and React manipulating the DOM, Oliver will rely on one of the two 

### Approachs
- Use a root Recat component to render an empty, customizable SVG.
- Wrap D3 methods in lifcycle methods. Pass D3 methods in as a method. The limitation here is that server side rendering is not possible with this approach.
- Use D3 for math and React for renderening. This is the approach Oliver will take.
