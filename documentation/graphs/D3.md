# D3 in Oliver

Oliver will display graphical information to make data visualization easier to comprehend. I have chosen to use D3 for this task as it is commonly known as the gold standard for data visualization - however this comes with several known challenges.

Integrating D3 into a React project can be difficult because D3 uses data binding whereas React uses unidirectional data flow. D3 loads data, binds data to elements in the dom, transforms the elements by interpreting data, and transitions elements in response to user input. React on the other hand uses a virtual DOM to measure changes in state. To integrate these two libraries let React handle displaying the SVG information and D3 handle the math needed to render data.
