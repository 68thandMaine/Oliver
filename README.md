# Welcome to Oliver

It's my budgeting app and it's in development.

> Currently I am building a static site using data I define in mock files. As soon as the general look of Oliver is complete then I will begin to work on the frontend logic. For the static version of Oliver I am using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/#what-is-tailwind) to build a custom style library. My priority will be exploring neumorphic design, accessibility principals, and using [d3](https://d3js.org/).
